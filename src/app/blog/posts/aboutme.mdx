# 👋 Hey there!

I’m Sinu — a software engineer deeply passionate about embedded systems, IoT, robotics, coding, automation, AI, and all things that spark innovation. My journey into tech wasn’t just about writing code; it was (and still is) about building things that move, sense, respond, and ultimately, make life smarter.

# 🛠️ Why I Build

Ever since I got my hands on a microcontroller, I’ve been hooked. There’s something magical about turning raw hardware into intelligent systems — whether it’s a smart light that responds to your voice or a robot that learns to follow lines.
Over time, my passion evolved from tinkering solo to teaching others and building tools that empower the next generation of innovators.

That’s why I started NextBot Labs.

# ⚡ NextBot Labs

NextBot Labs is a platform I founded to teach high school and engineering students the real-world magic of IoT and robotics electronics hardware. We don’t just talk theory — we get our hands dirty building systems that respond to the world.

From ESP8266-based smart home setups to fully interactive robotics kits, we’re on a mission to make hardware education exciting, accessible, and deeply practical.

# 🔍 What I’m Working On

Some of my recent and ongoing projects include:

 -**Tempro**- a smart temperature and environmental monitoring system
 -**IoT-based Smart Home System**- complete with voice control and real-time monitoring

All projects are documented with the aim to be open, replicable, and easy to understand for learners.

# 🌱 Why It Matters

India has immense untapped potential in the field of robotics and IoT. I believe that hands-on learning, when combined with mentorship and access to affordable tech, can ignite a whole new wave of innovators — not just consumers of tech, but creators.

Through NextBot Labs, I want to bridge the gap between textbook theory and real-world systems.

# 💡 What’s Next?

I’m constantly exploring new frontiers — AI in embedded systems, low-power hardware, and automation in personal development. I also love sharing what I learn, and I’m working on creating more free resources, project kits, and courses.

   

   “Build what you wish existed.” That’s the mantra I live by.**

Thanks for reading,
