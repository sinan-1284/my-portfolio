## Overview

The Automatic Fire Extinguisher System is an IoT-based prototype developed to prevent small-scale fire hazards automatically. It uses a flame sensor to detect fire and activates a water pump through a relay module to suppress the flames. Built using affordable hardware components, it’s ideal for areas like kitchens, server racks, or labs where quick suppression is critical. The system can also send alerts over Wi-Fi to notify the user in real time.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Fire Detection**: Flame sensor detects fire or abnormal temperature rise.
- **Auto-Extinguish Mechanism**:  Relay module activates a DC water pump or CO₂ sprayer.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications via Wi-Fi using Telegram Bot, IFTTT, or Firebasee.
- **Manual Override Option**: Optional switch or app control to activate extinguisher remotely.
- **Compact & Low Power**: Designed for small enclosures or micro-environments.

## Technologies Used

Hardware: Arduino, Flame Sensor, Relay Module, DC Pump, Buzzer, LEDs
Software: Arduino IDE
Cloud/Protocols: Wi-Fi (HTTP) ,Firebase (for alerts)

## Challenges and Learnings

This project presented challenges in ensuring fast flame detection without false triggers from ambient light sources. Calibrating the sensor and tuning the pump activation delay were critical. I learned to optimize ESP8266 response times, integrate real-time cloud alerts, and design a reliable automatic control loop for safety-critical systems.
