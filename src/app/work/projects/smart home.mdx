## Overview

 Smart Home IoT System is a prototype developed to enhance household safety and automation using affordable IoT hardware. The system enables users to remotely control home appliances via smartphone and get real-time alerts for fire, gas leaks, and unauthorized motion, thereby ensuring both convenience and security.


## Key Features

- **Fire & Gas Detection**: Flame and MQ-2 gas sensors alert users of emergencies.
- **Motion Detection**: PIR sensor detects intrusions and sends instant alerts.
- **Mobile App Control**: Appliances (lights, fan, etc.) are remotely controlled via a custom Android app.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifications via Wi-Fi using IFTTT, Telegram Bot, or Firebase.
- **Cloud Dashboard**: Live sensor data visualization and history tracking using ThingSpeak or Firebase.
- **Energy Monitoring**: Integration of ACS712 sensor to track power consumption.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: ESP8266 NodeMCU, Flame Sensor, MQ-2 Gas Sensor, PIR Sensor, ACS712 (optional), Relay Module, LEDs
- **Software**: Arduino IDE,  Android Studio
- **Protocols**: HTTP, MQTT 
- **Cloud Platforms**: ThingSpeak, Firebase
- **Other Tools**: Fritzing (circuit design), IFTTT or Twilio (alerts)

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I faced challenges such as ensuring stable Wi-Fi connectivity with the ESP8266 and minimizing false triggers from gas and motion sensors. Designing a user-friendly mobile interface taught me the importance of intuitive UX in IoT applications. I also gained experience in cloud integration, real-time data visualization, and the importance of securing IoT communications for safety-critical systems
