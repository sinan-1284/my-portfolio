## Overview

GetMyBus is a real-time bus tracking application currently under development. It aims to improve the public transportation experience by providing users with live bus locations, smart routing, and timely notifications. The app will especially benefit students and elderly commuters through simplified access to real-time travel information.

## Key Features

- **Live Bus Tracking**: Displays GPS-tracked bus positions on an interactive map.
- **Route Bookmarking**:  Save frequently used routes for faster access.
- **Alternate Route Suggestions**: Provides route options when no direct bus is available.
- **Arrival Notifications**: Notifies users of upcoming bus arrivals and service issues.
- **Cloud Dashboard**: Live sensor data visualization and history tracking using ThingSpeak or Firebase.
- **Concession Awareness**: Highlights fare concessions for students and senior citizens (UI only).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Flutter.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Realtime Database)
- **Location Services**: Google Maps API, GPS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Challenges and Learnings

Still in progress, but key challenges include optimizing GPS update frequency for mobile devices, implementing low-latency real-time tracking, and integrating dynamic maps with a clean, responsive UI. This project is helping me enhance my cross-platform mobile development skills and real-time data handling.
