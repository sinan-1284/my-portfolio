## Overview
Tempro is an IoT-based temperature monitoring system designed using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It provides real-time temperature readings and allows users to remotely track environmental conditions. This project is suitable for smart home applications, server rooms, or any environment requiring continuous temperature awareness.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Temperature Monitoring**: Captures accurate readings using a DHT22 sensor.
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Displays live temperature data via a smartphone interface and web.
- **Threshold Alerts**: Sends alerts to the user when the temperature crosses pre-set safe levels.
- **Cloud Data Logging**: Temperature readings are uploaded to platforms like ThingSpeak or Firebase for long-term analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
